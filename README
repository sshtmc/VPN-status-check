The program pings all the configured hosts, and lists their status.
If a program responds to the ping request, it's "Up" and green.
Otherwise, it's "Down" and marked in red.

Usage:

1. Configure the VPN networks that you want to check. At the moment I use N2N and hamachi (logmein)
2. Run the program:

$ vpn
# N2N nodes
192.168.2.34 dell7 # Up 
192.168.2.32  opsbm01 # Up 
192.168.2.33 sshtmc-laptop # Up 
# Hamachi nodes
5.124.120.170 dell02  # Up 
5.113.217.242  opsbm01 # Up 
5.42.83.186 dell7 # Up
